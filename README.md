# README test
This is just to test how linking together READMEs works and what happens with multiple markdown files in a folder

This repo has a very simple file structure to test a few things:
### File structure
```
.
├── README.md
├── folder_level1
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── README_2.md
│   └── folder_level2
│       └── README.md
```

## Linking to other files
Linking to other files and folders is easy in markdown you just write `[link text](link/target)` for example here I link to [folder_level1](folder_level1). Here is an example linking to a file, in this case [folder_level1/README_2.md](folder_level1/README_2.md).
