# This is a README at folder level 1
---

In this folder there are two files and one additional folder

Again, linking is easy with all links being relative to the folder the current file is in so to link to README_2 I need to do `[link text](README_2.md)`, [like this](README_2.md). To link back up folders you use the usual `../`, [like this](../).
